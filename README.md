# Scrolling Insights: Flutter vs CSS

In browsers, with HTML and CSS, scrolling is active by default. HTML elements auto-scroll when there is need for that. On the other hand, in mobile apps, when coding for Android & iOS, you must be intentional about what should scroll. As Flutter builds for these platforms, it is inherently constrained to "intentional scrolling". This is especially technical when you want to implement specific scrolling flavors.

In this session, we will simultaneously look at how to achieve the following scrolling behaviors in Flutter and in CSS (side-by-side comparison):
* How to scroll (you have to use Scrollable widgets)
* How to scroll horizontally (Axis.horizontal)
* How to achieve nested scrolling (slivers and shrinkWrap)
* How to pin some items when you scroll (combining slivers)
* How to occupy free space while allowing scrolling too (SliverFillRemaining)
* How to prevent the user from scrolling (NOT using Scrollable widgets)
